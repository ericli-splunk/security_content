description: This search detects the creation of a new Federation setting by alerting
  about an specific event related to its creation.
data_source: []
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory Operation="*Add service principal*" OR (Operation = "*principal*" AND action = "created")  
  | stats count by src_user src_user_type action Operation authentication_service Workload
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_added_service_principal_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: The creation of a new Federation is not necessarily malicious,
  however these events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential
  abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a different cloud provider.
